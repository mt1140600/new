If we reasonably conclude based on information available to us that your actions and/or performance in connection with the Agreement may result in a significant number of customer disputes, chargebacks or other claims in connection with the Prokure Site, then we may, in our sole discretion and subject to applicable Law, delay initiating any payments to be made or that are otherwise due to you under this Agreement for the shorter of: (a) a period of ninety (90) calendar days following the initial date of suspension; or (b) completion of any investigation(s) regarding your actions and/or performance in connection with the Agreement.

Further, you agree to provide any such information to Cerise Internet Technologies upon request.

Any taxes applicable in addition to the fee payable to Cerise Internet Technologies shall be added to the invoiced amount as per applicable Law at the invoicing date which shall be paid by you.
